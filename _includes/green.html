<p>Bothle is made entirely from recyclable materials.
For the Bothle we use eco plastics that give the possibility to recycle the Bothle.
For the battery we use water-based organic battery this new batteries are not only cheaper but also eco friendly.
Also there is no more risk of overheating the batteries.</p>
